== URLs

* PROD: campusmack.com
* STAGING: staging.campusmack.com

== Branch strategy

* production: this is always should be the same that we have on PROD
* staging: this is like master but with things we need to test on the server
* master: this is for daily commits and local tests

== General workflow

Developers are working in a separate branch or directly in the master branch,
depending on the task.
When the tasks are ready, master branch will be merged into the staging branch
and deployed to the STAGING server.
If everything looks fine there, staging will be merged into master and deployed to PROD.

== Running migrations on staging

heroku rake db:migrate --app campusmack-staging

== Deploy to staging

git push heroku-staging staging:master
