=== 1.2.0 / 2011-08-11

* Added #flagged_words to find the discovered offending words. (Thanks nilmethod/Chris Hobbs!)
* You can now instantiate Profanalyzer to have multiple analyzers with potentially different settings.

=== 0.2.1 / 2009-03-25

* Fixed some wordlist errors.

=== 0.2.0 / 2009-03-23

* Added an options hash to Profanalyzer#filter and Profanalyzer#profane?, letting you change settings but only within the scope of that call - using this hash won't change the global settings.

=== 0.1.1 / 2009-03-22

* Fixed the link to point to http://profanalyzer.rubyforge.org/

=== 0.1.0 / 2009-03-22

* First release

  * Separates racist, sexual, and otherwise profane terms
  * Rates each word on a scale from 0-5 of "badness", which is based on
    my subjective opinion, and the use of the word in non-profane ways
    (such as "ass" in "assess").
