<p class="about"><strong>What is Campusmack?</strong></p>

<p>Campusmack is a website where College Students, Alumni, and Fans alike can post and share content about rival campuses or the campuses they love.  Have you ever been frustrated by a friend, coworker, or family member who constantly gets in your face about how the College you love sucks?  Campusmack is designed to help you find and post dirt on the Campus your antagonist supports so you can put them in their place!</p>

<p>While it can be tough to hold back sometimes when talking smack, Campusmack wants to build an edgy yet clean environment for its users.  This means absolutely no bullying, nudity, or profanity.  Please Smack Responsibly!</p>

<p class="about"><strong>What is a Smack?</strong></p>

<p>A Smack is a photo, video, or news article about a Campus that can be used as smack talk against that Campus.  For example, a photo of a Duke basketball player getting dunked on by a UNC player would be a photo Smack that a user could post onto the Duke landing page.  Once the Smack is posted, it can be viewed by other users and sent as Smack to their rivals.</p>

<p class="about"><strong>What does &quot;Send as Smack&quot; do?</strong></p>

<p>Everything posted onto Campusmack can be sent as Smack Talk.  If you find a post on Campusmack that you’d like to rub in the face of the opposition, click the &quot;Send as Smack&quot; button associated with that post.  You’ll be brought to a landing page that allows you to import contacts from your preferred email provider (Gmail, Yahoo, AOL, etc.) and send an email to those you want to Smack.  You can type in a custom message and once you click “Send” and email will be sent from our servers to the people you selected to receive the Smack.  The content from the post you chose to share will show up in the recipients Inbox with a Subject line that reads &quot;You just got SMACKED by (your first name) (your last name)&quot;.</p>

<p class="about"><strong>What is a Redemption?</strong></p>

<p>A Redemption is a photo, video, or news article about a Campus that can be used as bragging rights.  For example, if a College is ranked by US News as having a top 10 MBA program, this would be a News Redemption a user could post onto that College’s landing page.  Redemptions can also be sent as Smack talk.</p>

<p class="about"><strong>What are the Conference Statistics on the Home page?</strong></p>

<img src="<%= root_url %>images/About/Conference Statistics.jpg">
<p>The snapshot above is of one of the Conference Statistics tables from the home page.  The Conference Statistics bar is made up of all Division I-A conferences.  Each table displays the top three Colleges from each conference in terms of total number of Smacks descending.  &quot;S&quot; is an abbreviation for &quot;Smacks&quot; and &quot;R&quot; is an abbreviation for &quot;Redemptions&quot;.</p>

<p>If you click on &quot;Full List&quot;, it will take you to a landing page with a full list of Colleges from that conference with their respective Smack/Redemption counts.</p>
