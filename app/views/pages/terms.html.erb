<p><strong>Order of Preference </strong>This Agreement governs your use and access to the Campusmack Technology. This
  Agreement does not modify, alter or amend any other specific agreement you have entered or will enter into with
  AppLyte. To the extent that any provision of this Agreement, or any supplemental agreement offered as any part of
  any registration for additional services on the Website or within the Campusmack Technology, conflicts with any
  provision of your other agreements with AppLyte, the terms and conditions of such other agreement shall, take
  precedence over the conflicting term(s) and conditions of this Agreement (unless otherwise expressly provided in
  such other agreement).</p>

<p><strong>Links to Other Web Sites </strong>The Campusmack Technology contains links to other web sites (&quot;Third
  Party Sites&quot;) controlled or offered by third parties (non-affiliates of AppLyte). AppLyte has no control over
  and is not responsible for the content, accuracy or opinions expressed on such Third Party Sites and such sites are
  not investigated, monitored or checked for accuracy or completeness by AppLyte. AppLyte has no ability to censor or
  edit the content of any Third Party Sites. AppLyte and its respective parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors,
  assigns, employees, agents, directors, officers and shareholders hereby disclaim any and all liability arising from
  your use of or access to any of the Third Party Sites, including but not limited to, any information, materials,
  products or services posted or offered at any of the Third Party Sites. By creating a link to Third Party Sites,
  AppLyte and its respective parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns, employees, agents, directors,
  officers and shareholders do not endorse or recommend any products or services offered or information contained at
  Third Party Sites, nor is AppLyte or its respective parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns,
  employees, agents, directors, officers or shareholders liable for any failure of products and services offered or
  advertised at those sites. Such third parties may have a privacy policy different from that of AppLyte and Third
  Party Sites may provide less security than AppLyte. Without limiting the foregoing, the Campusmack Technology may
  contain offers from AppLyte for products and services that may be obtained only by linking to the merchant web site
  to complete the transaction. Terms of the offer shown on the Campusmack Technology, including, but not limited to,
  price, color, quantity, availability and description may vary from those shown on the merchant's web site.
  Differences in the terms of an offer between what is displayed in connection with the Campusmack Technology and what
  is offered at the merchant web site will be governed by the terms shown on the merchant's web site. AppLyte and its
  respective parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns, employees, agents, directors, officers and
  shareholders are not responsible or liable for any such differences or discrepancies.</p>

<p><strong>Revisions and Consents </strong>AppLyte reserves the right to revise the terms and conditions of this
  Agreement at any time and for no or any reason whatsoever. AppLyte also reserves the right to make changes at any
  time, without notice or obligation, to any of the information, products or services contained on or offered through
  the Campusmack Technology (including, but not limited to, on the Website). Such updates, revisions, supplements,
  modifications and additional rules, policies, terms and conditions shall be effective immediately and incorporated
  in this Agreement upon notice thereof, which may be given by any reasonable means, including, but not limited to,
  posting such changes on the Website. By continuing to enter the Website and/or using the Campusmack Technology, you
  acknowledge and agree that you shall be bound by any such revisions. Accordingly, you should periodically review the
  terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>

  Agreement will remain in full force and effect.</p>

<p>AppLyte' or its respective parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns, employees, agents, directors,

  herein. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice shall act to modify any of the terms
  and conditions of this Agreement. AppLyte and its respective parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns,

  party at any time without notice to you. You may not assign this Agreement or the rights granted herein to any party
